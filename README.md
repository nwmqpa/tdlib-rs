# tdlib-rs

A Rust wrapper around the Telegram Database library. It includes a generator to automatically generate the types and functions from the TDLib's [Type Language](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/TL) file.

It's mainly created for using it in the [Telegrand](https://github.com/melix99/telegrand) client, but it should work also for any other Rust project.

Current supported TDLib version: [1.8.25](https://github.com/tdlib/td/commit/d93a99e3351db82573d765ce4f5e84714c277518).
